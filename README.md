## 🌱 Plant Watering Schedule Manager

A simple and intuitive Flutter app to help users manage and track watering schedules for their plants.

# 📌 Overview

The Plant Watering Schedule Manager is a lightweight mobile application designed to remind users when each plant needs watering. It allows users to add plants, assign watering intervals, and keep track of the next watering date — all within a clean, single-page UI.
No backend or external database is used; the app currently stores data locally in memory (or optionally using local storage if you add it later).
